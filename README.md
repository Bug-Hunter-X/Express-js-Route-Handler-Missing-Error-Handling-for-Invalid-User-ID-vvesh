# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid or unexpected input.  Specifically, this example focuses on a scenario where a user ID is parsed as an integer without sufficient validation.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that includes robust error handling.

## Bug:
The original code attempts to find a user by ID, but it fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid number. This can lead to unexpected errors or crashes.

## Solution:
The solution adds comprehensive error handling.  It validates the input to ensure it's a number before attempting to parse it and handles the case where no user is found.
